# rx_bloc_test

A Flutter package with the goal to enable testing [RxBlocs](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/RxBloc) from the [FlutterRxBloc package](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/FlutterRxBloc) with ease.

## rxBlocTest

Testing a specific `RxBloc` state can be done easily with the **rxBlocTest** function. Besides a test description, it has two required parameters: `build`, which should return the testing RxBloc and `state`, which is a specific state inside the provided bloc.

Additionally, like in most cases, the state may return values which can be compared against other values. Here comes the `expect` parameter which takes a list of expected iterables and compares them with the ones from the state.
```dart
rxBlocTest<CounterBloc,int>(
  'Emits [] when created',
  build: () async => CounterBloc(), 
  state: (bloc) => bloc.states.count,
  expect: [],
)
```
There is an `act` parameter which is a callback executed after the bloc has been initialized. It should be used to add events to the block. 
```dart
rxBlocTest<CounterBloc,int>(
  'Incrementing value',
  build: () async => CounterBloc(), 
  state: (bloc) => bloc.states.count,
  act: (bloc) async => bloc.events.increment(),
  expect: [1],
)
```
If you want, you can skip a custom amount of values that are emitted by the state by using the `skip` parameter. If no value is provided the default value of 1 is used, which will skip the initial value of the bloc state. The initial value can be included by setting the skip parameter to 0.

There is also a `wait` parameter which will wait for a given Duration to pass. This is useful especially when working with async operations.
```dart
rxBlocTest<DetailsBloc,String>(
  'Fetch third details data',
  build: () async => DetailsBloc(), 
  state: (bloc) => bloc.states.details,
  act: (bloc) async => bloc.events.fetch(),
  wait: Duration(milliseconds:100),
  skip: 3, // This will skip first two values + the initial value
  expect: ['Hello world'],
)
```
